# Weather-App
Shows what the weather is like anywhere in the world! This app is based off of the tutorial at https://www.studytonight.com/post/how-to-build-a-weather-app-using-javascript-for-complete-beginners, with some major changes:

*search bar was added so that the weather anywhere in the world can be displayed, not just the local weather
*background changes depending on time of day/weather
